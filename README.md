# 🎯 Subset Sum to Target (Backtracking in C++)

This project demonstrates how to use **recursion and backtracking** in C++ to find all subsets of a given list of integers that sum to a specific target value.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given an array of **distinct integers** and a target number, find **all subsets** whose elements sum up exactly to the target.

This is solved using a recursive backtracking approach.

## 📂 Example

**Input:**
```cpp
nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
target = 5;

**Output:**
[1, 4]
[2, 3]
